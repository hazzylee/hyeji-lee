I am Hyeji Lee, a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh.
I am seeking postdoctoral opportunities to investigate environmental effects on development, with particular interest in social influences, socioeconomic status, and adversity exposure. However, I remain open to other research themes that align with my expertise.

My doctoral research focuses on cognitive control development in children and adolescents, examining its role in different learning scenarios, using neuroimaging techniques (EEG and fNIRS). 

I have a keen interest in translational science for educational settings, particularly developing interventions to support children and adolescents who are at risk or in need.
