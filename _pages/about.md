 I am Hyeji Lee, a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. I am seeking postdoctoral opportunities beginning in 2026.

### Current Research
My doctoral research focuses on cognitive control development in children and adolescents, examining its role in different learning scenarios, using neuroimaging techniques (EEG and fNIRS). This research is supported by the Korean Government Scholarship Program for Study Overseas, Ministry of Education, South Korea and Research support grant from the University of Edinburgh.

### Bridging Education & Development Science
Originally trained in Education, I maintain strong connections to educational policy while pursuing developmental science research. I have been working as a correspondent for the Korean Educational Development Institute since 2023, writing articles on UK educational policies for Korean scholars and policymakers. My research aims to discover how scientific insights on cognitive development can enhance educational interventions and inform policy decisions for supporting diverse learning needs. Building on this foundation, I plan to expand my post-doctoral research by investigating how environmental factors—particularly social influences, socioeconomic status, and adversity—affect development, with the goal of creating more effective interventions for children and adolescents at risk.
