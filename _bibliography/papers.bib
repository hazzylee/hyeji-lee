  abstract={Most human decisions are made among social others, and in what social context the choices are made is known to influence individuals' decisions. Social influence has been noted as an important factor that may nudge individuals to take more risks (e.g., initiation of substance use), but ironically also help individuals to take safer actions (e.g., successful abstinence). Such bi-directional impacts of social influence hint at the complexity of social information processing. Here, we first review the recent computational approaches that shed light on neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying social influence following basic computations involved in decision-making: valuation, action selection, and learning. We next review the studies on social influence from various fields including neuroeconomics, developmental psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, and highlight three dimensions of determinants—who are the recipients, how the social contexts are presented, and to what domains and processes of decisions the influence is applied—that modulate the extent to which individuals are influenced by others. Throughout the review, we also introduce the brain regions that were suggested as neural instantiations of social influence from a large body of functional neuroimaging studies. Finally, we outline the remaining questions to be addressed in the translational application of computational and cognitive theories of social influence to psychopathology and health.},

  abstract={Smoking is a severe addictive health risk behavior and notorious for the high likelihood of relapse after attempted cessation. Such an addictive pattern in smoking has been associated with neurobiological changes in the brain. However, little is known whether the neural changes associated with chronic smoking persist after a long period of successful abstinence. To address this question, we examined resting state EEG (rsEEG) in chronic smokers who have been smoking for 20 years or more, past-smokers who have been successfully abstaining for 20 years or more, and never-smokers. Both current-smokers and past-smokers showed significantly decreased relative theta power than never-smokers, showcasing persistent effect of smoking on the brain. Other rsEEG features in alpha frequency band demonstrated distinctive patterns associated with active smoking, such that compared to never-smokers, only current-smokers, but not past-smokers, showed significantly higher relative power, EEG reactivity-power changes between eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions-, and coherence between channels. Furthermore, individual variabilities across these rsEEG biomarkers were accounted for by individuals' self-reported smoking history and nicotine dependence in current- and past- smokers. These data suggest the persistent effect of smoking on the brain even after sustained remission for 20 years.},
